\section{Preparing PDF files}

Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and
not, for example, ``A4.''

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file
must only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few
instructions to achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader,
  select the menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show
  All Fonts. You can also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes
  with \verb+xpdf+ and is available out-of-the-box on most Linux
  machines.

\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose
  fonts are also acceptable for NIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap
  fonts.  Use "solid" shapes instead.

\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You
  should use the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or
\verb+\mathbb{C}+ for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You
can also use the following workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the
\verb+amssymb+ package.

\end{itemize}

If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we
will ask you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always
specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the
example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly
hyphenate a line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the
\verb+\-+ command when necessary.

acknowledgments go at the end of the paper. Do not include
acknowledgments in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper.
